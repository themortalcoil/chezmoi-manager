## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Changes

#### New Classes
1. **DiffStatsPanel**: Dedicated statistics widget
2. **FileListPanel**: Scrollable file selector widget

#### New Methods
- `show_error()`: Display errors in dedicated panel
- `hide_error()`: Clear error panel
- `_extract_changed_files()`: Parse diff for file list
- `action_export()`: Export diff to file
- `action_next_change()`: Navigate to next change
- `action_prev_change()`: Navigate to previous change

#### Enhanced Methods
- `_fetch_diff()`: Now returns `(success, content, error)` tuple
- `update_diff()`: Handles success/failure cases separately
- `_apply_changes()`: Better error handling with ChezmoiCommandError
- `on_worker_state_changed()`: Smarter result type detection

### Error Handling Strategy

```python
# All operations wrapped in comprehensive try-catch
try:
    result = ChezmoiWrapper.get_diff(self.target)
    return (True, result, "")
except ChezmoiCommandError as e:
    # Specific chezmoi errors
    error_msg = f"{str(e)}\n\nStderr: {e.stderr}"
    return (False, "", error_msg)
except Exception as e:
    # Unexpected errors
    return (False, "", f"Unexpected error: {type(e).__name__}: {str(e)}")
```

### State Management
- `self.current_diff`: Stores current diff content
- `self.changed_files`: List of files with changes
- `self.has_error`: Tracks error state
- `self.target`: Current file filter (empty = all files)

---

## 🐛 Crash Prevention

### Before (Crash Points):
1. ❌ No error handling on ChezmoiWrapper calls
2. ❌ Assumed TextArea always has valid text
3. ❌ No validation before accessing worker results
4. ❌ Crashes on empty or malformed diff output
5. ❌ No recovery from worker failures

### After (Bulletproof):
1. ✅ All external calls wrapped in try-catch
2. ✅ Validates TextArea state before operations
3. ✅ Checks hasattr() before accessing attributes
4. ✅ Handles empty, None, and malformed inputs
5. ✅ Worker error state handler added
6. ✅ Graceful degradation on all failures
7. ✅ User can retry without restarting app

---

## 📊 Statistics Parsing Algorithm

```python
def _extract_stats(diff: str):
    """
    Parses diff using regex patterns:
    - Files: 'diff --git a/(.*?) b/'
    - Additions: Lines starting with '+'
    - Deletions: Lines starting with '-'
    - Excludes: '+++' and '---' (file markers)
    """
```

**Handles:**
- Multiple file formats
- Unified diff format
- Git diff format
- Empty diffs
- Malformed diffs

---

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before → After

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Error Display** | Generic text in diff area | Dedicated error panel with suggestions |
| **File Selection** | View all or specify one manually | Click files from list to filter |
| **Statistics** | None | Real-time stats with 4 metrics |
| **Navigation** | Manual scrolling only | Jump between changes with n/p |
| **Export** | Not available | One-click export to .patch file |
| **Apply Confirmation** | Basic yes/no | Shows affected files list |
| **Layout** | Single column | Sidebar + main content |
| **Recovery** | Crash → restart app | Error → retry with 'r' |

---

## 🚀 Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: Diff loaded in background worker
- **Efficient Parsing**: Regex patterns optimized
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Updates only changed components
- **Thread Safety**: All heavy operations in separate threads
- **Memory Efficient**: Doesn't duplicate diff content

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios Covered

1. ✅ Empty diff (no changes)
2. ✅ Single file diff
3. ✅ Multiple files diff
4. ✅ Large diff (100+ files)
5. ✅ Malformed diff output
6. ✅ Chezmoi not found
7. ✅ Chezmoi command fails
8. ✅ Permission errors
9. ✅ Network timeout
10. ✅ Worker crash
11. ✅ Apply success
12. ✅ Apply failure
13. ✅ Export success
14. ✅ Export failure (disk full, permissions)
15. ✅ Navigation at start/end of diff

## 📝 Future Enhancements (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Side-by-side comparison view
- [ ] Search within diff
- [ ] Filter by file pattern
- [ ] Copy selection to clipboard
- [ ] Syntax highlighting themes selector
- [ ] Diff history/timeline
- [ ] Undo applied changes
- [ ] Partial file apply (apply specific hunks)

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Always Return Tuples**: Makes worker result handling clearer
2. **Dedicated Error UI**: Better than mixing errors with content
3. **State Tracking**: `has_error` flag prevents invalid operations
4. **Type Checking**: `isinstance()` for worker result discrimination
5. **Graceful Degradation**: App usable even when features fail
6. **User Guidance**: Error messages should suggest solutions
