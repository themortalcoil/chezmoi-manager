## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Had to manually type full file paths
- No way to know if file was already managed
- No preview of what would happen
- Basic success/error messages
- Only manual typing for file input

### After:
- Click to select common dotfiles
- Pre-flight check for already managed files
- Live preview of operation with hints
- Detailed success messages with next steps
- Multiple input methods (type, select, browse)
- Context-aware error messages with suggestions
- Better visual feedback throughout the process

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test common file selection from list
2. Try to add an already-managed file (should show warning)
3. Toggle options and watch preview update
4. Use browse button to select files
5. Add a file and verify detailed success message
6. Try various error scenarios to see helpful suggestions

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Multi-file selection (batch add)
- Drag and drop file paths
- Recently added files list
- Template variable suggestions based on file type
- Undo/rollback functionality
- Dry-run mode with full preview
- Integration with diff viewer before adding
